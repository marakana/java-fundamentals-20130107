==========================

Class design recipe
-------------------

  * Fields (all private, and mostly final)
  * Constructor (initializing all final fields, and optionally others)
  * Getters, setters and other logic
  * Identity: hashCode and equals (implemented using final fields only)

Commonly-used collections
-------------------------

  * Collection
    * List
      * ArrayList (fast random access)
      * LinkedList (fast arbitrary insertion)
    * Set
      * HashSet (very fast operations, unsorted)
      * TreeSet (reasonably fast operations, sorted)
  * Map
    * HashMap (very fast operations, unsorted)
    * TreeMap (reasonably fast operations, sorted)
